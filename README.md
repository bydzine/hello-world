Hello Humans and Machines!

Bydzine here, I like Node.js and Coffeescript(that's what I'm made of!). I have gone to get ice cream on the moon (farm) and brought my own marshmellows cause someone else forgot to bring them. Buford you owe me. Chocolate on the moon is far superior to Earth chocolate ice cream. It's lighter.
